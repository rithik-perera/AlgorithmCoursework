## Pathfinding Challenge Solver

This project tackles a pathfinding challenge commonly encountered in video games using Java. Leveraging the A* algorithm, it provides a solution to navigate a character through a grid-based map filled with frictionless ice and obstacles, aiming to reach a designated endpoint from a starting position.

### Features
- Implements the A* algorithm for efficient pathfinding.
- Parses input files to extract map information.
- Provides step-by-step instructions for traversing the map.
- Conducts performance analysis to evaluate algorithm efficiency.

### Usage
1. Compile and run the Java program.
2. Input the map details and follow the instructions to navigate the character to the finishing coordinates.
